* Replace `bgrt-fallback.png`(recommended size is 256*256px) and `watermark.png` in path `/usr/share/plymouth/themes/armbian/` in the OS.</br>
  ```
  sudo mv ./bgrt-fallback.png /usr/share/plymouth/themes/armbian/bgrt-fallback.png
  sudo mv ./watermark.png /usr/share/plymouth/themes/armbian/watermark.png
  ```
* If you don't like to display `bgrt-fallback.png` or `watermark.png`, you can delete them directly by
  ```
  sudo rm /usr/share/plymouth/themes/armbian/bgrt-fallback.png
  ```
  or
  ```
  sudo rm /usr/share/plymouth/themes/armbian/watermark.png
  ```
* `throbber-*.png` is a lot of png images generated by the script based on `spinner.gif`. Customization is not recommended. If you don't like this spinner, you can delete it directly by
  ```
  sudo rm /usr/share/plymouth/themes/armbian/throbber-*
  ```
* Update logo by
  ```
  sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R armbian
  ```
* Wait for the command to complete and then restart.
* `sudo apt upgrade` may automatically update the logo to armbian from the internet. If you don't want this, you can use
  ```
  sudo apt-mark hold armbian-plymouth-theme
  ```
  to disable the logo update.
