### Safety Warning

<font  color="red">**IMPORTANT!**</font> 

Before performing any maintenance on the printer or its electronics, always power off and disconnect the printer to prevent short circuits and potential damage. This is especially important when disassembling parts like the hotend, as exposed wires and components can cause electrical damage if the printer is on. For any concerns or questions, contact our support team for assistance.

### Tools and Parts Needed

- H2.0 Hex Key
- Stock Hotend Cooling Fan
- Stock Mounting Screws(for heatsink and cooling fan)

### Preparation

Cut the filament manually with the cutter lever and ensure the nozzle temperature has cooled to below 50℃ and the power to the printer is turned off.

### Disassembly

**Step 1 - Remove the Front Housing**

Remove the front housing assembly completely by disconnecting the fan connector.

**Step 2 - Disconnect Cables**

<font  color="red">**Note: Before attempting to disconnect the thermistor connector on the X1/X1C, please ensure that you press the buckle/latch to open it. The thermistor plug is equipped with a buckle/latch, which is different from the fan and heater connectors. Neglecting to open the buckle/latch before disconnecting the thermistor connector could result in damage to the thermistor plug and/or the PCB connector.**</font> 

Disconnect the hotend fan and the heater connectors from the board, and remove the wires by sliding them out of the clip shown in the image below (indicated by a red arrow).

<font  color="red">**Make sure to securely tighten the hotend screws using an H2.0 hex key, and avoid over-tightening.**</font> 

**Step 2 - Connect the Hotend Cables**

Tuck in the heater cable wires back into the clip
Connect the very small 2-pin thermistor plug, the 4-pin hotend cooling fan plug, and finally, the larger 2-pin ceramic heater plug.
Tuck the wires back into the clip.

## How to Verify

Power on the printer and run the device’s **Calibration** process. If the process passes, it means the operation has been successful.

## Slicer Settings

Click the "Edit Icon" and enter your filament settings. 

<img src=img/Panda_Revo_X1_Hotend/Panda_Revo_X1_Hotend_In15.png width="600"/>

Change the "Max volumetric speed" under "Filament" to around 35-40, depending on the filament you are using. 
If you observe signs of under-extrusion, lower this number until print quality is restored.
