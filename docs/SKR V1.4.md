## **Interface Introduction**

### USB Power Supply

After the SKR mainboard is powered up, the D5 red light in the lower left corner will go on, indicating normal power supply. The 5V SEL in the middle of the board is the power selection terminal；

1、When using USB to power the motherboard：

2、When using 12v-24v power supply：

<img src=img/SKR_V1.4/SKR_V1.4_USB2.png width="600" />

### Connection

SKR motherboard communicates with the computer through the [USB] interface. The computer needs to install the driver program first and then insert the motherboard into the computer to identify the port for data transmission. Without installing the driver, it is easy for the computer to fail to recognize the USB port.Using the Marlin2.0 firmware, follow the tutorial for installation:

### Drive Mode and Selection Method

1、Common STEP/DIR mode: (for example: A4988, DRV8825, LV8729, ST820, etc.) select the short circuit cap to connect MS0-MS2 according to the driver subdivision table.

<font  color="red">**Note: if you are using A4988 or DRV8825 driver, you must connect RST and SLP with jumper cap.** </font>

For details, please click: https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/Tutorials.html

2、TMC Driver-UART Mode: (eg: TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2225, etc.) Each axis uses a shorting cap to connect the red frame in the figure. The subdivision and drive current are set by firmware.

<font  color="red">**Note: When using the TMC2209, if you don’t use the stallguard function, you need to cut off the DIAG pin on the driver so that the mechanical switch can work normally. The operation method is as shown below:** </font>

<font  color="red">**Note: This function pin needs to be trimmed only when the blocking detection function is not used.** </font>

3、TMC Driver-SPI Mode: (such as: TMC2130, TMC5160, TMC5161, etc.) Each axis uses four shorting caps to connect the red frame position in the figure. The subdivision and drive current are set by firmware.

## **Marlin**

The firmware description of SKR motherboard

<font  color="red">The factory motherboard is installed equipped with firmware for testing (model I3), which can be used directly or changed according to your own needs. </font>

1、The Firmware Acquisition Method of SKR Motherboard:

Obtain by Ask customer service or technical personnel;

Download at our Company Open source website: https://github.com/bigtreetech

2、Marlin2.0 Firmware update method

After downloading our open source Marlin2.0 firmware, use Visual Studio Code to open the project to compile, then find the firmware.bin file, copy it to the SD card, and then reset the motherboard. For detailed steps, please refer to the tutorial:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/ppjfflhf3j5yzh2/MarlinV2.0%20SKRV1.1%20instruction.docx?dl=0

## **Precausions**

1. The motherboard 5V SEL must connect VDD and +5V two pins before printing (that is, 12v-24v power supply must be provided to the motherboard for printing);
2. The power of the hot bed connected to the motherboard must be less than or equal to 144W (that is, the thermal bed resistance is greater than 1Ω). If you want to use a high-power hot bed, you must connect an external hot-bed power expansion board;
3. Firmware file names in SD card cannot be changed (including letter case)；
4. The wiring process and plug-in drive process must be carried out under the premise of power failure. The power can be put on after checking the correct connection of the line and the correct insertion of the drive, so as to prevent the wrong connection line from burning the motherboard and driver and causing unnecessary losses；
5. To replace the configuration file, please backup the factory configuration file to record the pin number of each part of the chip, and then change the new configuration file!
