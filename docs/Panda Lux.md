## **Installation Instructions**

The following instructions use the Bambu Lab P1P as an example.

**Step 1:** Attach the Panda Lux to the underside of the printer's front door frame, centering it in place.

*The Panda Lux has built-in magnets that allow for easy installation. For additional reinforcement, double-sided adhesive tapes are included in the package but are not required.

**Step 2:** Remove the protective cover off of the AP board if you are installing on a P1 printer (USB port PCB) or open the plastic cover on the right side of the frame if you are installing on a X1 printer.

**Step 3:** As shown in the image, route the Panda Lux cable along the edge seam to the top.

*For additional stability to prevent the cable from moving, use the electrical tape provided in the package to secure the cable firmly to the door frame.

**Step 7:** Insert one end of the connection cable into the AP board's stock light bar port, and insert the other end of the connection cable into the adapter board.

Note: The stock lightbar connector location on X1 series is on the left side of the frame behind the plastic cover.
