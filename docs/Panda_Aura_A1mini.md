## Important Notes

* Panda Aura A1 & A1mini include two models: Panda Aura A1 (for A1 printer) and Panda Aura A1mini (for A1mini printer), also referred to as Panda_Aura in some places. Please pay attention.

* Panda Aura A1 & A1mini only monitor the printer’s status and do not control the printer, so the functionality of Panda Aura A1 & A1mini will not be affected by Bambu firmware updates. For more information on affected and unaffected features, please refer to the [Bambu Lab Official Announcement](https://blog.bambulab.com/firmware-update-introducing-new-authorization-control-system-2/).

* Panda Aura A1 & A1mini only supports connection to 2.4G Wi-Fi.

* After connecting Panda Aura A1 & A1mini's AP hotspot in the setup interface, the Web UI interface will directly open. Due to permission issues on some phones, firmware uploads may not be possible on this page. Please visit the Web UI in a browser to upload files.

* If you encounter any issues not covered in this wiki, please contact customer support via: `support01@bigtree-tech.com`.


## Product Overview

Panda Aura A1 & A1mini instantly transforms the A1 / A1 mini printers into desktop focal points. This product includes colorful light effects and audio-visual alarms, with customizable RGB lighting and sound effects, which can be controlled through Web UI or the mobile app (coming soon).
