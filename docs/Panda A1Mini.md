## **Introduction**

The BIQU Panda Claw is an extruder gear set, designed with golden RNC nano-coated hardened steel gears and aluminum CNC idler arm. It is tailored to improve the performance and durability of extrusion systems in the X1, P1, and A1 series printers, offering an upgrade that enhances filament flow and printing precision.

## **Feature Highlights**

- **Abrasive-Resistant**: Made from hardened steel with RNC nano-coating, the Panda Claw is highly resistant to wear-and-tear from abrasive filament.
- **Enhanced Stability and Durability**: The lightweight, high-strength, ultra-tight tolerance idler arm eliminates unwanted movement, ensuring stable feeding, while the brass spur gear provides self-lubricating properties for a longer lifespan.
- **Precision**: The five-spoke lightweight design minimizes moving mass, ensuring exceptional accuracy for perfect prints.
- **Compatibility**: The Panda Claw is compatible with Bambu Lab X1/P1/A1 series printers.

## **Replacement Guide**

In this guide, you will learn how to replace the stock extruder gear with our Panda Claw on the A1.

### Step 1: Remove the Stock Extrusion Gear

1.Remove the Hotend Assembly

Cut the Filament (if necessary): If the filament is in the loading state, use a filament cutter to cut it off first.

Press the Toolhead Cover from both sides to unlock and remove it.

Pull the protrusion on the side of the Hotend Silicone Sock by hand and remove the Sock.

Remove the rotating wheel.

Use an H1.5 hex key to remove the two screws.

Take off pressure block.

2.Loosen the Filament Cutter

Use an H2.0 hex key to remove the screw and release the filament cutter.

Clean the Internal Filament Debris: Use tweezers and a blower to clean out any filament debris and residue.

Manually rotate the yellow gear clockwise for cleaning while the power is off, or alternatively press the "retract" button on the screen while the power is on to rotate the extruder wheel to the specified angle for cleaning.

3.Remove the Extrusion Gear

1)Remove the Filament Hub Assembly: Use an H2.0 hex key to unscrew the two screws and then carefully remove the filament hub. 

  Be careful not to damage the black FPC cable. After removing the filament hub, you can place it on top of the tool head as shown in the picture below.

3）Remove the Driven Wheel Bracket: Use an H2.0 hex key to unscrew the side screw and carefully remove the bracket.

Be cautious as the internal spring and end cap can easily fall off. Use tweezers to carefully remove them to prevent loss.

Now that you've removed the stock extruder gear, we can start installing the Panda Claw.

### Step 2. Panda Claw Assembly Instructions

1.Install the Extrusion Gear

Lubricate the gear (highlighted in green in the image below) before installing the extrusion gear.

<font  color="red">**Notes: Make sure you don’t get any grease on the filament gear teeth(highlighted in blue in the image below). If you do, just wiping it off won’t help. You’ll need to wash the gear with soap to remove the grease and then apply new grease after that.**</font>

2.Install the Driven Wheel Bracket

Install the driven wheel bracket to the corresponding shaft. Assemble the spring and end cap in the correct orientation and placement, referring to the provided images for guidance below. Utilize tweezers to carefully position them within the driven wheel bracket. The side screw should remain untightened temporarily.

**Important:**

Ensure that the spring and end cap are installed properly. Incorrect installation may result in the gear failing to grip the filament, leading to print failure.
